            <p>Four Phoenix is a corporation that specialises in digital marketing. We intend to give good traffic to small and medium-sized businesses at a fair cost. This allows people from all walks of life to enter the digital world. They also achieve their target audience's minimum reach. Because the entire world is becoming increasingly digital. Many small and medium businesses have suffered greatly as a result of the outbreak. They can only survey as little as they thought in this digital environment. The majority of products are judged not just on their quality, but also on where they are purchased. We can't haggle for a goods in a large showroom. However, we negotiate for small items in roadside shops as well. The roadside shopper must give their product in exchange for a return of investment rather than a profit.
As a result, they lost not only their profit but also their courage at that time. Do you believe that the large showroom product cost includes more than just the goods? No, I don't believe so. They had to assess the costs of building rent, maintenance, d√©cor, and air conditioning, among other things, before deciding on the product price because they had already established their brand with the public. As a result, customers began to trust them before purchasing the product. Our services are designed to instil trustworthiness in all types of businesspeople. As a result, your company's brand is well-known among our target demographic.</p>

            <p>Mrs. S. Nivetha Parthiban, our founder</p>
            <p>After finishing a B Tech IT degree, I began working as an IT recruiter. Communication is the main issue to survey in that industry at the beginning stage. On one particularly lovely occasion, the people on the opposite side do not speak Tamil and must converse in English. At that point, I realised that English is not a skill, but rather a means of communicating our views. Following that, there is a significant career pause due to personal reasons such as marriage or the birth of a child. Then you wish to re-enter the workforce. However, no corporate company is willing to hire a career-break mother, who will only have a chance in startup enterprises. While you're on break, learn more about digital marketing to pique your curiosity. It will also lead to the creation of a Fita Academy certification in Advanced Digital Marketing.</p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Following that, they began working as unpaid interns and received practical training. Finally, it leads to the establishment of one's own business. Because many homemakers are educated and brilliant, raising children is the sole reason for them to abandon their careers. As a result, we must train them freely and allow them to work independently. No one owns anything in this world; everyone is on an equal footing. We've been put together to work on a single project. The portion will be allocated according to project estimates. Money isn't vital, but it will give us bravery, self-assurance, and help us shine our personalities.</p>
            <p>Trust the women who know that due of their family situation, they are unable to overcome, that you should take your time and choose your career from the comfort of your own house.</p>
